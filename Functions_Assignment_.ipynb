        "**Q1. What is the difference between a function and a method in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans1- In Python, the core difference between a function and a method is their association with a class and how they are called. A method is a function that belongs to a class, while a function is a standalone block of code.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ex-  A standalone function is called by its name.\n",
        "It can operate on many different types of objects.\n",
        "my_string = \"hello\"\n",
        "print(len(my_string))\n",
        "\n",
        " A method is called on an object using dot notation.\n",
        " It is specific to the type of object it is called on.\n",
        "print(my_string.upper())\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q2. Explain the concept of function arguments and parameters in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans2- Function arguments and parameters are fundamental concepts in Python that define how data is passed into a function [1]. They are often used interchangeably, but there is a technical distinction between them:\n",
        "\n",
        "Parameters: These are the names defined in the function's definition that specify the types of input the function expects to receive. They act as local variables within the function's scope, waiting to receive values when the function is called [1, 2].\n",
        "\n",
        "Arguments: These are the actual values or variables passed into the function's invocation (when it is called). The arguments are assigned to the corresponding parameters [1, 3].\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q3. What are the different ways to define and call a function in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans3- Using def keyword (Standard Functions): This is the most common way to define a function in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q4. What is the purpose of the `return` statement in a Python function?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans4- In Python, the return statement serves two primary purposes within a function:\n",
        "\n",
        "Exiting the function: When a return statement is encountered during the execution of a function, the function immediately terminates. Any code within the function that appears after the return statement will not be executed.\n",
        "\n",
        "Returning a value to the caller: The return statement can optionally be followed by an expression, which represents the value that the function will send back to the part of the code that called it. This returned value can then be used in further calculations, assigned to variables, or printed, among other things. If no value is specified after return (i.e., just return), the function implicitly returns None.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q5. What are iterators in Python and how do they differ from iterables?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans5- In Python, iterators and iterables are fundamental concepts for working with sequences of data.\n",
        "\n",
        "An iterable is any object that can be iterated over, meaning you can loop through its elements. Examples of built-in iterables include lists, tuples, strings, dictionaries, and sets. An object is considered iterable if it implements the __iter__() method, which returns an iterator.\n",
        "\n",
        "An iterator is an object that represents a stream of data and provides a way to access the elements of an iterable one at a time.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q6. Explain the concept of generators in Python and how they are defined?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Generators in Python are a special type of function that returns an iterator, allowing for the efficient generation of a sequence of values on demand, rather than storing the entire sequence in memory. This makes them particularly useful for handling large datasets or infinite sequences.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q7. What are the advantages of using generators over regular functions?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans7- Generators are more memory-efficient and performant than regular functions, especially for large datasets, because they use lazy evaluation to produce values one at a time with the yield keyword instead of creating the entire sequence at once. This also makes them ideal for processing infinite sequences and creating composable data processing pipelines.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q8. What is a lambda function in Python and when is it typically used?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans8- A lambda function in Python is a small, anonymous function defined using the lambda keyword. Unlike regular functions defined with def, lambda functions are anonymous, meaning they do not have a name, and are restricted to a single expression.\n",
        "\n",
        "Short, one-time operations: When a simple function is needed for a brief period and defining a full def function would be excessive.\n",
        "\n",
        "Higher-order functions: They are frequently used as arguments to higher-order functions like map(), filter(), and sorted(), where a quick, custom function is required to process elements.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q9.  Explain the purpose and usage of the `map()` function in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans9- The map() function in Python serves to apply a given function to each item in an iterable (like a list, tuple, or set) and returns an iterator that yields the results. It provides a concise and often more efficient way to perform transformations on collections of data compared to explicit loops.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Purpose:**\n",
        "The primary purpose of map() is to enable functional programming paradigms by applying a transformation function across an entire iterable without needing to write explicit for loops. This can lead to more readable and potentially more performant code, especially when dealing with large datasets.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q10. What is the difference between `map()`, `reduce()`, and `filter()` functions in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans10- The Python functions map(), filter(), and reduce() are all higher-order functions used for functional programming paradigms, but they serve distinct purposes:\n",
        "\n",
        "    map =    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
        "        squared_numbers = list(map(lambda x: x*x, numbers))\n",
        "        # squared_numbers will be [1, 4, 9, 16]\n",
        "\n",
        "         filter = numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n",
        "        even_numbers = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers))\n",
        "        # even_numbers will be [2, 4, 6]\n",
        "\n",

        "Q11.  Using pen & Paper write the internal mechanism for sum operation using  reduce function on this given\n",
        "list:[47,11,42,13]?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans11- The reduce function, often found in functional programming paradigms, iteratively applies a given function to the elements of a sequence, accumulating a single result. For a sum operation on the list [47, 11, 42, 13], the internal mechanism unfolds as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "Initialization: The reduce function takes a binary function (in this case, an addition function) and the list [47, 11, 42, 13]. If an initial value is not explicitly provided, the first element of the list (47) is used as the initial accumulator.\n",
